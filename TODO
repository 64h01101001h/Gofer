- It seems like it's X or Y, not X and Y, for example; make sure
  that's actually what's happening.   The point here is that if either
  thing matches, we have a match.

- There could be a problem where we have two ors combined by a
  nearby, and we match both ends of both ors, but the nearby clause
  would have worked the other way than the way the program naturally
  did it; make sure this doesn't happen.

- The match highligher seems to have developed a new tendency to
  highlight way too much text.   Figure out why.

- Write a manual page.

- Figure out why the next match code menu item is getting highlighted
  only once, at the end of the whole search, and why it's
  unhighlighted the first time it gets used, and finally why asking
  for the next match doesn't actually go to another match.

- Figure out why if we don't sleep for ten seconds to let the text view
  stabilize, it crashes when we try to seek to the matching text.

- Better yet, stop using the textview widget, which is incredibly
  slow and requires us to convert the whole file into an attributed
  string in order to display it, which is probably why it's incredibly
  slow.

- Add a way to allow the user to just type and have completion done on
  the files to match, so that you can do the same search GMR is doing
  without navigating a bunch of clumsy menus.   Make this a preference,
  since some people don't think the menus are clumsy and are good at
  navigating them.

- Make the UI swap between setup and search, so we can use less screen
  real estate.

- Linux (GTK+?) GUI.

- Windows GUI.

- If we replace the TextView widget, try to make it so the code for that
  can also be used in Windows and Linux.

- At the user's option, transliterate the text into Tibetan.   This is a
  nice-to-have, but really not important at all.   Unless you want to
  collect heaping wozages of merit with Christie-hla.

- When cutting and pasting out of gofer, allow the user to set a preference
  that says that the name of the file gets cut out as well.

- Fix the problem where when the later of two matches that are nearby
  crosses a line, we use the line the match *starts* on instead of the
  line the match *ends* on, and therefore maybe don't print the whole
  match.
